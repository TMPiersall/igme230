                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I created a new title sequence and additional animated assets for use in NMD's social media and promotional work.<br>The goal I set for myself was to try and embody the spirit of New Media Design. To get this across I chose a sketching and wireframing theme, as within the major we all use these skills often.</p>
                <h2>Process Work</h2>
                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <img src="images/Sketches.jpg" class="sketch" alt="Image not Found">
                <p>I started by narrowing down what it means to be in New Media and what would then make the most sense as a channel ID. I went through many options as we are versitile and can do many things.</p>
                <h3>Styleframes</h3>

                <img src="images/mographprog1.png" alt="Image not Found">
                <p>In Adobe Illustrator I hashed out some styleframes of key moments of the animated opening. It would start by drawing in the New Media logo to look like it was a wireframe. The intro would then end by the true logo popping in and gleaming like the screens we design for. </p>
                <h3>The Complete Package</h3>

                <p>To finish off I created additional components to the intro animation, namely a transition slide and an end card. Throughout the animation process I used namely Adobe After Effects as well as Adobe Illustrator for certain componnents and masking.</p>
