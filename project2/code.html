            <h2>Main Page</h2>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>I had no idea how to do a dropdown menu. I ended up turning to w3schools to tell me how. Even so their example wasn't a perfit fit and I had to do some extra tweaking to get it to look right and fit with the styling I already had going. Once I got it working it was easy enough to copy and paste my html and styling onto the other pages.<br>The next navigation hardship was the mobile version. Mobile doesn't have a hover state so a dropdown wasn't going to work. I wanted to try a hamburger menu but I was running out of time and I knew I just didn't have the skill for that or the time to teach myself. I decided it would be easiest to simplify the nav so that the logo became the home button and the work section was the sole navigation to my portfolio pieces. It's not as efficient of a solution as I would've liked but we all have our limitaions, for now.</p>
            <h3>Header</h3>
            <P>The largest issue here was the background image. I figured out I could use cover to get it to fit most screen widths which solved the problem of it making the text hard to read.</P>
            <h3>Work Section</h3>
            <p>I had a lot of trouble with the "Work" section of the first page. I was being a bit ambitious with the layout of the image links and ended up having to simplify it in the end because I couldn't quite get it to work the way I would've liked it to. I like the way it turned out, luckily,but I spent a lot of time trying to position and reposition the images and eventually turned to a design more suited to my level of html and css know how.</p>
            <h3>About Section</h3>
            <p>A hardhip I faced here was with the alignment of the text next to the image. I don't believe I ever quite fixed the problem, as it still gets a little ridiculous if you're viewing it on anything less than half a screenwidth but otherwise I ended up compensating with a margin on the paragraph tag.</p>
            <h3>Contact</h3>
            <p>I've never had a link open someone's email before. That was interesting to riddle out. I did a couple google searches and found that the code to do so is already built into html5 so it was easy enough.</p>

            <h2>Project Pages</h2>
            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
            <p>They were pretty straight forward. They didn't all need different styling or anything like that. The hardest it got was dealing with the process images so that they would still be big enough to look at but fit within the box provided, and making the gifs small enough file size to not overwhelm the browser and make it hard to load. In the future I would like to impliment some js to let allow the images to be clicked on and get larger for the viewer but for now it is what it is.</p>

            <h2>Resume</h2>
            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
            <p>The biggest hardhsip with this page was making sure that the print media query was working properly. I've never had to do anything like this before so I wasn't entirely sure how to do it. Lucklily I found out that it was simple enough and it turned out just fine. <br> By this time all styles were already in place and it became a metter of copy and paste to the right locations.</p>

            <h2>Sources</h2>
            <h3>Fonts</h3>
            <p>Both fonts used, Merriweather and Raleway, were accessed through <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Merriweather|Raleway">Google Fonts</a></p>
            <h3>Code</h3>
            <p>The only chunk of code used that was pulled and then tweaked was my dropdown menu. You can access the same example and information I did here on the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dropdowns.asp">w3schools website</a>. I also used them as a refereance for any other double checks on how to use html and css but no other direct code was copied or pulled.</p>
