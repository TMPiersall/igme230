                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>RIT has a monthy magazine for students to enjoy. The goal was to redesign their website so that it's more accessable to students and faculty who read and enjoy podcasts<br>I wanted to make it more customizable to make it easier for returning users to access content that they most enjoy or read most often. I wanted to accomplish this goal without turning away users who have no desire to create an account so I focused on a customizable but not pushy layout.</p>
                <h2>Process Work</h2>
                <h3>Wireframes</h3>

                <img src="images/wireframes4.jpg" class="sketch">
                <p>To get a better idea of what I wanted the site to do and look like I put together a series of wireframes that laid out the basic idea of functionality and layout.</p>
                <h3>Comps</h3>
                <img src="images/Comps1.jpg">
                <img src="images/Comps3.jpg">
                <p>The wireframes led to some color compositions to get a better feel for style and effectiveness of interface elements. Ultimately I decided the color choice and icons were just not working and would have to be simplified.</p>
                <h3>Finals</h3>

                </div>
                <p>For the final product, I followed up with mobile components and additional screens to demonstrate the ideas of potential interactivity as well as the main desktop page seen up top.</p>
