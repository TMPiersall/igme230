<p id="verse1">I'll admit it. I'm drowning.<br>
I'm sinking, swallowed by it all<br>
collapsing in on me<br></p>

<p id="verse2">I do my best to breathe<br>
It could be that something is broken<br>
or it could be that I'm imagining<br>
the weakness.</p>

<p id="verse3">But what am I to do?<br>
I ignore it sometimes,<br>
I panic others,<br>
there's no good answer to the question.</p>

<p id="verse4">I speculate to pass the time.<br>
It's so easy to imagine<br>
the scenarios where I rise or fall.</p>

<p id="verse5">Worry makes it worse<br>
as stress is stressfuly the cause of more stress.<br>
It's not that easy.<br>
It's not that easy.</p>

<p id="verse6">I won't give up<br>
without a fight<br>
I will not fall.<br>
I will not fall.</p>
